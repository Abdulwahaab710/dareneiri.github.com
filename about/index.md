Hey! Thanks for stopping by. If you are looking for information about my academic research, go to [dareneiri.com](http://dareneiri.com)

I am a long-time IT/help desk employee, first at UC San Diego's Academic Computing & Media Services, and now with Wolfram Research. For some of that time, I was involved with scientific research on honey bees (my BS and MS degrees are in biology). Pursuing my interests, I started a PhD program at University of Texas, Austin. That  lasted a year, simply because it no longer aligned with my [long-term personal goals](http://dareneiri.com/2014/10/30/why-i-decided-to-leave-academia/). 

Now, I'm crossing my fingers and getting back to my childhood roots -- fixing computers and exploring latest developments in technology -- but I would not call myself a programmer. 

My goals are to work my way through code, get a bit more familar with scripting, and find something I am passionate about. I am here to learn. That is what you will find here. 

 

## Setup

* This site is using the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* I could have easily done with this WordPress, but that would have been too simple!


Thanks for reading!
