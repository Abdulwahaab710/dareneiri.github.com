Hey! Thanks for stopping by. If you are looking for information about my academic research, go to [dareneiri.com](http://dareneiri.com)

I am a long-time IT help desk/systems technician, first at UC San Diego's Academic Computing & Media Services, and now with Wolfram Research. For some of that time, I was simultaneously involved with scientific research on honey bees (my BS and MS degrees are in biology). Pursuing my academic interests, I started a PhD program at the University of Texas, Austin. That  lasted a year, simply because it no longer aligned with my [long-term personal goals](http://dareneiri.com/2014/10/30/why-i-decided-to-leave-academia/).


Now, I want to get back to my childhood roots: exploring the latest developments in technology, more recently as it applies to cloud computing infrastructure and emerging solutions in systems administration.


My goal here is to write about these topics, teach myself a few things, and improve my knowledge and technical skills in the process. 



## Setup

* This site is using the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* I could have easily done with this WordPress, but that would have been too simple!


Thanks for reading!
