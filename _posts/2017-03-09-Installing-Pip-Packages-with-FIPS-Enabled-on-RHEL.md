## How to install pip packages for python when FIPS is enabled on a RHEL7/CentOS7 machine

I came across a problem recently with one of the machines I work with running RHEL7. FIPS is enabled, not allowing the md5 hash to be used for verifying python packages when using pip. 

On RHEL7.3 Python 2.7.5 is installed.
<pre>
$: python -V
Python 2.7.5
</pre>


If I attempted to install pip, per [the documentation](https://packaging.python.org/installing/#install-pip-setuptools-and-wheel), I would eventually get a "Unknown hash name: md5" error: 
<pre>
$: curl â€“O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$: python get-pip.py
Collecting pip
  Downloading pip-9.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (1.3MB)
Unknown hash name: md5
</pre>


The problem is that FIPS is enabled (noted by the "1"): 
<pre>
$: cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled
1
</pre>


For my environment, I cannot turn off FIPS. You can spin up a clean CentOS 7 VM and do the above and it works just fine beacuse FIPS isn't enabled. If you run into this issue, then you you need to do the following: 
1. Install pip via rpm:
<pre>
curl -O ftp://mirror.switch.ch/pool/4/mirror/centos/7.3.1611/cloud/x86_64/openstack-newton/common/python-pip-8.1.2-1.el7.noarch.rpm
</pre>
