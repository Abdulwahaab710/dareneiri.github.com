Hey! Thanks for stopping by. If you are looking for information about my academic research, go to [dareneiri.com](http://dareneiri.com)

I am a long-time IT/help desk employee, first at UC San Diego's Academic Computing & Media Services, and now with Wolfram Research. For some of that time, I was involved with scientific research on honey bees (my BS and MS degrees are in biology). Pursuing my interests, I started a PhD program at University of Texas, Austin. That only lasted a year, simply because it no longer aligned with my [long-term personal goals](http://dareneiri.com/2014/10/30/why-i-decided-to-leave-academia/). 

Now, I'm crossing my fingers and getting back to my childhood roots -- fixing computers and exploring latest developments in technology -- although I am far from being a programmer. 

I am not a programmer. 

Though, my goals are to work my way through code, get a bit more familar with scripting, and find something I am passionate about. I am here to learn

## What is the Deal With TextEdit Files?
When I learn something new, especially when it came to getting jekyll to work with GitHub, and learning Git at the same time, I make notes in TextEdit. That is not always the best solution. This is an attempt to post my own discoveries about troubleshooting my own problems online. Maybe someone will find this useful, but at the very least it will help me archive my notes in a more organized, and comprehensive manner, as compared to a bunch of TextEdit files. 

## Setup

* This site is using the theme [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com), built on Poole. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* I could have easily done with this WordPress, but that would have been too simple!
